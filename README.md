# Text-Editor
- this is one of my first larger projects

- Minimal text editor with some functionalities of vim program from Unix OS.
- At program execution, the user can insert text into a file and can be modified depending on the command entered from standard input.
- Application written in C language, deeply capitalizing on data structures: list, stack, queue.
